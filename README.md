# DHBW-Rapla-Delivery

## Why ?
Since the DHBW hasn't configured the rapla calendar to be able to subscribe it with the apple calendar, I decided to build my own application, so I can subscribe the rapla calendar.

## What does it do ?
The application parses the Rapla HTML file located at an url and exposes the file with the help of an REST-Controller.

## Libs used
ICal4J - Used to generate the .ics file
Java Spring - To provide the .ics file on an endpoint
Jsoup - To retrieve and parse the html File
